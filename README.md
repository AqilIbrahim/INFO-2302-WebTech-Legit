1. **Project Description**

    Tourism refers to the actions of individuals who go to and stay in areas beyond their typical surroundings for leisure, business, or other reasons. Basically our project is to create a website that can attract all people around the world to come and enjoy all the interesting places in Malaysia. We will inform them about the services available to them throughout their vacation via our website. All photographs of notable spots in Malaysia will be posted on our website, providing tourists with a better understanding of how to arrange their vacation.


    With this website, we can provide additional options for tourists to explore new activities that they may enjoy within their trip. It might be the finest experience of their lives if they can do so many things throughout their vacation, and this website may be the perfect option to allow them to have all of those experiences.
